A project span of several years, while generating thousands of documents and terabytes of data.\n"},"content":"<p><img src=\"/img/n23/header.jpg\" alt=\"header\" title=\"header\" class=\"\" /></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The N23 Westfrisiaweg connects west and east North Holland. From 2013 till 2017, the province of North Holland, Netherlands <em>(dutch; Provincie Noord-Holland)</em> will work on the improvement of this major road, in a collaboration of many parties.</p>\n<p>A collaboration with so many different corporations - like the goverment, water authorities, contractors and engineering firms - make efficient communication hard. In a project of this kind, it is of great importance that every party involved possesses the correct data, at the moment they require it.</p>\n<p>In several brainstorm sessions we have thought about questions like; how to ensure that everyone is using the latest document versions. How to be sure that everyone shares the data other corporations require. How to be sure that communication goes smooth and efficient. And not to forget, how to be sure that sensitive data is only shared with the persons who are authorized to.</p>\n<p>We have thought about this - and are still improving trough so called cycles of continuous improvement - and we came up with DDM N23 (Durable Data Management).</p>\n<p>The project structure has been peeled to extract the several disciplines, so called project themes. The work processes that belong to each project theme, have been optimized and are digitaly integrated in an online platform. Most of the data generating work now happens trough simple wizards in this online platform. So when someone has to consume data, he can be certain that he has the latest data, and only the data he is permitted to use.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Managing this project is different than other projects, because of the way we use modern techniques. Let&#39;s clarify;</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/n23/viewer.jpg\" alt=\"viewer\" title=\"viewer\" class=\"left\" /> A single online platform, that shows everyone the data they require and are permitted to access. Visible data is controlled by a strong system of user rights.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/n23/datatable.jpg\" alt=\"data table\" title=\"data table\" class=\"left\" /> Spatial data can be queried spatially. We shouldn&#39;t be looking for document <em>&quot;2014-AXLTR-V2&quot;</em> when we are talking about <em>&quot;that roundabout&quot;</em>. In this project we say - let me show you! - and simply zoom to the correct location.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/n23/dataroom.jpg\" alt=\"dataroom\" title=\"dataroom\" class=\"left\" /> All contract related documents are accesible trough a online &quot;DataRoom&quot;. A shared - folder based - document system. Just like you know it from Windows Explorer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/n23/workflow.jpg\" alt=\"workflow\" title=\"workflow\" class=\"left\" /> Most, if not all, data generating processes are managed through online wizards. So all data is stored in an uniform format, and automatically made available to other stakeholders.</p>\n"}
